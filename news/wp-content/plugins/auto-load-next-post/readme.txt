Increase the pageviews on your site and reduce bounce rates as readers continue reading your posts infinitely scrolling down the page.

== Description ==

You have great content. That's great but you shouldn't have to work twice as hard to get the pageviews you want. While Auto Load Next Post is not the only infinite scrolling plugin out there it is the first that is designed to work and match the theme you are using and track the content that is viewed and not the excerpts in your post archives like other plugins out there. All of your posts content!

**Auto Load Next Post templating experience is the best in class - _by a long shot_.**

Don't take my word for it. [Read what Rich Tabor](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/best-in-class-35/) (Author of [ThemeBeans](https://themebeans.com/?utm_source=wp-plugin-repo&utm_medium=link)) had to say in his review.

= What is Auto Load Next Post? =

Auto Load Next Post is a WordPress plugin developed to increase your pageviews by engaging the site viewers to keep reading your content rather than increasing your bounce rate.

It simply automatically loads the next post on your blog once the user has reached the bottom of the initial post the viewer is reading and repeats the process as the user reads your content until there are no more posts to load.

= How does it work? =

A post navigation at the end of the post is used to identify and find the previous post URL for the next post to load. Once the previous post has been found it loads that post by inserting the content via a customizable repeater template and places the content underneath the parent post within the post container.

JavaScript detects when you are reading the next post and updates your browser URL address bar and page title to that post. Should you refresh the browser, the post you are currently reading would load as the new initial post.

All previous posts of the blog are still retained in your browser history and to top it off, you can track each post read the same way a single post is tracked as a pageview using Google Analytics.

= Note to Beginners =

== Installation ==

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don't need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Auto Load Next Post, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "Auto Load Next Post" and click Search Plugins. Once you've found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly, of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

If the theme already supports Auto Load Next Post then you do not need to complete the remaining steps:

1. Go to the plugin settings page by 'Settings > Auto Load Next Post'.
2. Enter each of the selectors specified for the theme you are using and press "Save Changes".

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is Auto Load Next Post free? =

Yes! Auto Load Next Post's core features are and always will be free.

= Will Auto Load Next Post work with my theme? =

Yes, Auto Load Next Post will work with any theme but may require some configuration for it to understand your theme. Please see the [documentation](https://autoloadnextpost.com/documentation/?utm_source=wp-plugin-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=faq-link) for help or read further down to see if your question has already been answered.

= Is Auto Load Next Post translatable? =

Yes! Auto Load Next Post is deployed with full translation and localization support via the 'auto-load-next-post' text-domain. [How to translate?](https://autoloadnextpost.com/documentation/can-i-install-auto-load-next-post-language/?utm_source=wp-plugin-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=faq-link)

= Where can I request new features and add-ons? =

You can vote on and request new features and add-ons on the [public roadmap](https://trello.com/c/OcC1oDGE/1-submitting-new-ideas).

= Where can I find the settings for this plugin? =

Go to **Settings -> Auto Load Next Post**. There you will find the options to change any of the theme selectors, enable Google Analytics and remove comments.

= Is overriding the repeater template file required? =

No. This was put in place to support themes that have coded their template files differently from [WordPress theme code standards](https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development#Theme_Development_Standards). For example, the [Genesis Framework](https://autoloadnextpost.com/product/genesis-framework-support/?utm_source=wp-plugin-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=faq-link) displays content via many action hooks instead so for this case overriding the template is a required.

= How can I override the repeater template file? =

You first need to create a new folder in your active theme directory called **auto-load-next-post** like so: **wp-content/themes/your-theme-name/auto-load-next-post/** and copy the repeater template file **content-alnp.php** from the plugin template folder into that new folder.

Now you can modify it to match how your theme’s content is loaded for a single post. This will be the repeater template the plugin will use to load posts with from now on.

> PHP knowledge will be required.

= Can I use JetPack Social Links and Like Button? =

Yes. No further configuration is needed if you already have JetPack setup with social icons and like button.

= Is it compatible with the JetPack's related posts module? =

This is not possible but it would also drive away the purpose of this plugin if related posts where to be displayed.

= Can I load content before and after the next post has loaded? =

Yes, you can. In the repeater template, there are [action hooks](https://autoloadnextpost.com/documentation/action-hooks/?utm_source=wp-plugin-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=faq-link) that you can use.

I have also prepared a [plugin demonstrating](https://github.com/AutoLoadNextPost/alnp-action-hooks-demonstration) the action hooks used when called. Simply download and install the plugin to see where you can place content.

= After the first post has loaded, all I get is the same post over and over again. Why is that? =

If you have this issue and you have created a custom repeater template file to support the theme then you may have placed the post navigation outside of the post query.

You need to place it inside the loop. If that is not the case then you have not included the content of the post correctly according to the theme you are using.

= Does the plugin detect my theme and insert the theme selectors for me? =

If the theme author has added support for Auto Load Next Post and has set the theme selectors then yes, it will set the theme selectors for you. If not supported then it does not. You may follow this guide to help you [find your theme selectors](https://autoloadnextpost.com/documentation/find-theme-selectors/?utm_source=wp-plugin-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=faq-link).

= My theme does not work with the plugin, what do I do? =

Check that you have a post navigation at the end of your post. If one does exists then you may need to copy and modify the repeater template file **content-alnp.php** in order to support your theme.

Not all themes are coded the same way so some alterations will be needed to match the theme. If you need help with this then I can provide [theme support](https://autoloadnextpost.com/product/theme-support/?utm_source=wp-plugin-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=faq-link) on request.

= What is the post order? =

The post order is descending order from the initial post the visitor started reading from.

= How can I get the Google Analytics option to work? =

You first need to have Google Analytics added to your site. Either by inserting the analytics into your theme yourself or by using the [Google Analytics plugin by MonsterInsights](https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-analytics-for-wordpress/).

Once you have Google Analytics applied to your site you can enable to track each post via the plugin settings.

= Can I track Facebook Pixels instead? =

You can. All you have to do is simply install the [Facebook Pixel Tracking add-on](https://wordpress.org/plugins/alnp-facebook-pixel-tracking/) and activate. All that is required is that you have your Facebook Pixel tracker installed on the site first.

= Does Auto Load Next Post support WordPress Network / Multisite websites? =

It does. Just make sure that you activate the plugin on the site you want it used on and then make sure the selectors match the theme that site is using.
